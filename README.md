## Greetings, my name is Denis Bubutanu, a third-year student at Queen Mary University of London studying Mathematics. 

I created this GitHub account while learning programming (both self-taught and guided) in the hopes of documenting and sharing my programming journey! 


## Where I code

- VSCode (main)
- PyCharm


## Languages

- JavaScript
- Python
- HTML
- CSS

This list is rapidly growing! I added HTML, CSS and JavaScript to my toolbax in the last six months. I hope to demonstrate my skills with each of the above (and any future languages) via projects posted on my page.
